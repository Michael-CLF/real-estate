A commission condition form is permitted, not universally mandated for a private no-broker seller. Use only the listed subsection (7) transfer exceptions. This agreement uses delivery before the buyer signs; provide the written statement before offers to avoid a later acceptance interruption. The combined PDF must include the applicable written known material facts unless a statutory transfer exception applies, plus the radon notice and available known records. N.D.C.C. 47-10-02.2 independently requires written known radon information and the statutory warning, with the buyer signed receipt, before executing an agreement except a lawful expressly agreed alternative. Furnish reasonably available known prior test results and mitigation evidence before execution. No new radon test or mitigation is universally required. This packet is independent of condition-disclosure exceptions and records actual receipt of its immutable version. The dated buyer signature acknowledges receipt of the separate statutory notice; it does not certify test accuracy, mitigation effectiveness or create a statutory testing contingency."}]},
